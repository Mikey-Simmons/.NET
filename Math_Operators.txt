C# Math Operators

Write code to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ints.

Code:
    int sum = 7 + 5;
    int difference = 7 - 5;
    int product = 7 * 5;
    int quotient = 7 / 5;

    Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
    Console.WriteLine("Difference: " + difference);
    Console.WriteLine("Product: " + product);
    Console.WriteLine("Quotient: " + quotient);

Output:
    Sum: 12
    Difference: 2
    Product: 35
    Quotient: 1

As you can see:

+ is the addition operator
- is the subtraction operator
* is the multiplication operator
/ is the division operator

However, the resulting quotient of our division example may not be what you may have expected.
The values after the decimal are truncated from quotient since it is defined as an int, and int cannot contain values after the decimal.
