//Exercise - Character Escape Sequences and Verbatim Strings
//Suppose you've been asked by your manager to create a mockup of a command-line tool that will generate invoices in both English and Japanese. 
//You don't have to build the actual functionality that generates the invoices yet. You only need to provide the command line's user interface to internal customers in the billing department for their approval. Your manager asked you to make sure you add formatting to make the current progress of the tool clear. Your manager also asked you to provide instructions for the Japanese users on how to generate invoices in Japanese.

//Formatting Literal Strings in C#
//C# provides a wealth of options for formatting strings. We'll only look at a few of the most used in this module. However just about anything you can imagine, you could accomplish. 
//The hardest part may be knowing what terminology to use when searching for answers.

//An escape character sequence is a special instruction to the runtime that you want to insert a special character that will affect the output of your string. In C#, the escape character sequences begin with a backslash \ and then include another character. For example, the \n sequence will add a new line, and a \t sequence will add a tab.

//The following code uses escape character sequences to add whitespace.

Console.WriteLine("Hello\nWorld! These are my c# notes!");
Console.WriteLine("Hello\tWorld!");

//What if you need to insert a double-quotation mark in a literal string? If you don't use the character escape sequence, 
//you'll confuse the compiler because it will think you want to terminate the string prematurely ... 
//and will not understand the purpose of the characters after the second double-quotation mark.
//To handle that situation, use the \" escape sequence.

Console.WriteLine("Hello \"World\"!");

//What if you need to use the backslash for other purposes, like to display a file path?
//The problem is the sequence \s. The \r doesn't produce an error because it is a valid escape sequence for a carriage return. 
//However, it's unlikely that you would want to use a carriage return in this context.

//To solve the problem, you use the \\ to display a single backslash.

Console.WriteLine("c:\\source\\repos");

//Verbatim String Literal

// A verbatim string literal will keep all whitespace and characters without the need to escape the backslash. 
// To create a verbatim string, use the @ directive before the literal string.

Console.WriteLine(@"   c:\source\repos   
      (this is where your code goes)");


//Unicode Escape Characters

//You can also add encoded characters in literal strings using the \u escape sequence,
//then a four-character code representing some character in Unicode (UTF-16).

// Kon'nichiwa World
Console.WriteLine("\u3053\u3093\u306B\u3061\u306F World!");


//There are several caveats here. First, some consoles like the Windows Command Prompt will not display all Unicode characters. 
//It will replace those characters with question mark characters instead. 
//Also, the examples used here are UTF-16. 
//Some characters require UTF-32 and therefore require a different escape sequence. 
//This is a complicated subject, and this module is only aiming at showing you what is possible. 
//Depending on your need, you may need to spend quite a bit of time learning and working with Unicode characters in your applications.

//Format the output of the command-line application using unicode escape characters

//To complete the mocked up command-line user interface, we'll add a phrase in Japanese that translates to "To generate Japanese invoices", then provides a verbatim literal string with the application executable with a flag. 
//We'll also add some escape sequences for formatting.

Console.WriteLine("Generating invoices for customer \"ABC Corp\" ...\n");
Console.WriteLine("Invoice: 1021\t\tComplete!");
Console.WriteLine("Invoice: 1022\t\tComplete!");
Console.WriteLine("\nOutput Directory:\t");
Console.Write(@"c:\invoices");

// To generate Japanese invoices:
// Nihon no seikyÅ«-sho o seisei suru ni wa:
Console.Write("\n\n\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u8acb\u6c42\u66f8\u3092\u751f\u6210\u3059\u308b\u306b\u306f\uff1a\n\t");
Console.WriteLine(@"c:\invoices\app.exe -j");

//RECAP
//Here's the most important items to remember about formatting literal strings:

//Use character escape sequences when you need to insert a special character into a literal string, like a tab \t, new line \n, or a double quotation mark \".
//Use an escape character for the backslash \\ when you need to use a backslash in all other scenarios.
//Use the @ directive to create a verbatim string literal that keeps all whitespace formatting and backslash characters in a string.
//Use the \u plus a four-character code to represent Unicode characters (UTF-16) in a string.
//Unicode characters may not print out correctly depending on the application.
