C# Notes
String concatenation is "programmer speak" for simply combining two or more values into a new value. 
Unlike addition, the second value is appended to the end of the first value, and so on.


To concatenate two strings together, you use the string concatenation operator, which is the plus symbol +.

Code:
    string firstName = "Bob";
    string message = "Hello " + firstName;
    Console.WriteLine(message);

Notice the order -- the first string "Hello " is first in the new string, and the value in the firstName variable is appended to the end of it.

You can perform several concatenation operations in the same line of code.

Code:
    string firstName = "Bob";
string greeting = "Hello";
string message = greeting + " " + firstName + "!";
Console.WriteLine(message);

Unless you have a good reason to do so, you can (and should) avoid using intermediate variables by performing the concatenation operation as you need it.

Code:
    string firstName = "Bob";
    string greeting = "Hello";
    Console.WriteLine(greeting + " " + firstName + "!");
